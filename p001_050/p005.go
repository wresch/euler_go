2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers
from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

\emph{What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all
of the numbers from 1 to 20?}

Let \(n\) be the smallest number divisible by integers \(2..k\).

At a minimum, n has to contain all the prime numbers \(<= k\)
as factors.  The non-prime integers have to be factorized
and any factors not yet represented by just the prime numbers
need to be included.  For the case of 20:
\begin{equation}
2 * 3 * 2 * 5 * 7 * 2 * 3 * 11 * 13 * 2 * 17 * 19 = 232792560
\end{equation}`
